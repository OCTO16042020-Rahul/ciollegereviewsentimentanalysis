Rly. & Harbour Rly.) and shares the same campus with the very famous Bhavans college. Due to the ongoing Metro work since the last few years, the roads are in dilapidated condition and don\'t be surprised if the autowallahs blatantly refuse to ferry you to the college. BEST buses to the college are equally unmotivating. Students who travel by train, most of the times, prefer to walk while  a few opt for the share rickshaw on the SV Road. ',' Infrastructure is decent. Campus is one of the largest amongst the engineering colleges in Mumbai. Lack of ACs might pull it down a bit but the natural environment is a plus point. Sardar Patel College of Engineering (SPCE) building might look old but they have the best infrastructure with reference to labs & workshops. Classrooms are average while washrooms are not very clean. Library is very much equipped with truckload of books. ',' The faculty at Sardar Patel College of Engineering is decent. They have enough knowledge about the subject to teach and clear your doubts, if any. Not very strict. Students from the reservation backgorund find the teachers extremely helpful as apart from academics, they do help in solving their personal problems.',' Attendance is not too strict either. A minimum of 60% of attendance in all subjects is recommended but dont worry if you cant satisfy the critiera. Test marks carry more weight-age over the attendance. But with the crowd that you find in the college, most often you end up attending lectures.',' Being one of the top rated colleges in Mumbai, SPCE has a very studious crowd. Definitely you will meet many nerds and geeks. A bunch of cream crowd can also be expected followed by students from the reserved category. Eventhough it is located in the western suburbs and has a not-so-accessible location, students from every possible nook and corner of the city are seen here. Good fun loving life. \"\", quotes a student.',' The canteen is pretty big as compared to other colleges, but with 7 branches (SPCE and SPIT combined), it seems a little small. The menu is good ranging from punjabi to chinese to Indian to South Indian. There is a sandwich counter as well. The menu is decently priced. Apart from the canteen, great snacks are available right outside the campus and franky, boy!.. thats a hot favourite among the students.',' Sardar Patel College of Engineering (SPCE) exhibits excellent records and scores over most colleges. It is one of the oldest colleges in Mumbai and hence has a name and legacy  attached to it. Round about 50%-60% of the students apply for placements, the rest go for higher studies. 100% placement record. Students are placed in companies like Reliance Energy, Leighton, L&T, Siemens etc. Average salary is around Rs. 3 to 4 lakh p.a.',' Rs. 63938/- per year',' Sardar Patel College of Engineering (SPCE) Bhavans Campus, Munshi Nagar, Andheri (West), Mumbai 400 058 Tel.

If you wish to save even more time, and spend some more money, you could take a rickshaw which would get you there in not more than a couple of minutes.',' One massive plus point about M.E.S. Pillaiâ€™s Institute Of Information Technology (PIIT) is its Massive campus, which is surprisingly clean by engineering college standards. The washrooms are NOT cramped and do NOT smell like a fart bomb. All in all, itâ€™s a nice environment to study (or not study) in.',' The faculty at Sardar Patel College of Engineering is decent. They have enough knowledge about the subject to teach and clear your doubts, if any. Not very strict. Students from the reservation backgorund find the teachers extremely helpful as apart from academics, they do help in solving their personal problems.',' Attendance is not really an issue, with 40-50% guaranteeing safety.',' The crowd isnâ€™t too bad either- thereâ€™s a healthy girl-boy ratio, and the overall feedback is â€˜chilled outâ€™. Quite a few students from nearby villages, though. Due to linguistic minority quota, you can expect a lot of Malayalam speaking students.',' The canteen at M.E.S. Pillaiâ€™s Institute Of Information Technology (PIIT) is of an acceptable standard, with edible and more importantly, affordable, food.',' The placements hadnt been impressive till recently but theyve shown some improvement in last couple of years. The college manages to place close to 50% of the students with decent salaries. Of course, those who DO get placed are pretty happy, with companies like Accenture offering acceptable salaries of 3.2 lac per annum.',' BTech Fee: Rs. 90,000/year',' M.E.S.

The campus is just about 5-6 minutes away from the railway station and its not a very bad walk either.',' This is where Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE) takes a hitting somewhat. As of now, it doesnâ€™t really have anything like a â€˜campusâ€™, itâ€™s just a building. The building however has been newly constructed and the labs are well-equipped, which is not something every engineering college can brag about. So those who intend to spend a good few years in engineering could definitely look at it as an option.',' The faculty at Sardar Patel College of Engineering is decent. They have enough knowledge about the subject to teach and clear your doubts, if any. Not very strict. Students from the reservation backgorund find the teachers extremely helpful as apart from academics, they do help in solving their personal problems.',' They say youâ€™ll be safe if you maintain around a 60%, which isnâ€™t too bad. Even if you find yourself well below that mark, no â€˜strict actionâ€™ as such is reportedly taken at Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE). Probably a couple of assignments or test papers to be written. Fair enough.',' Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE) faces a problem very similar to most colleges located in village-like areas- village crowd. About 40% of the crowd comes from villages. Most students say itâ€™s better than the general Airoli crowd, but doesnâ€™t come close to the colleges in Mumbai. Thank you for that.',' The students say the canteen at DMCE is not worth describing, which we assume means that its quite rubbish. What they did tell us, though, is that there have been cases of students having to be admitted to hospitals after eating from the canteen. Oh dear!!',' This is why some students go all the way to Airoli. The placements in general are pretty good, with companies like Infosys and Patni taking students in big numbers. The Civil Engineering department has an excellent placement record of 100%. Chemical and Mechanical Engineering departments have below average placements, though. The Chemical department, in particular, has really underwhelming placements. Overall placements are about 50%.',' B.E.

A 15 - 20 minute ride in a rickshaw should take you to Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering (better known as Fr. Agnel College of Engineering) from Bandra railway station (Western Railway & Harbour Railway) but that would be a bit expensive. BEST bus 211 starts from Bandra station and drops you right outside the college gate which happens to be the last stop. Having said that, the frequency is simply superb.',' ',' Recently Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering has hired a lot of new faculty. The old professors are quite good in the sense that they do teach and students can understand if they attend. Some students find the teaching pretty okay in the Computer dept. while the Production dept. seems very strict. Few of the faculty members are helpful and open to doubts.',' Attendance at Fr CRCE is quite strict. It has to be maintained above 75% no matter what. No grace attendance given even for students participating extra-curricular. Every week attendance is checked. If the weekly attendance is less than 75% then the student wonâ€™t be allowed to attend the lab sessions. Long procedure to be followed if name appears in defaulters. Parents are called and lengthy assignments are given as punishment. It is not a place to be in if you want to bunk too much! A lot of students even call it a JAIL.',' Crowd is dominated by students fit to become rocket-scientists at Fr. Agnel College of Engineering. There is a Catholic minority quota from year 2013-14 hence the crowd is bound to be dominated by Catholic students. Life during college is quite restricted, though people manage to enjoy anyway. Boys to girls ratio is decent. Crowd is very jovial towards festivals and other extra curricular activities. Being a popular and reputed college in the island city, youre bound to meet students from different backgrounds and localities. Northern, Western suburbs followed by and some from the central suburbs and Navi Mumbai are seen here. Location plays a vital role in such a diversified college.',' It is quite congested, food is edible but not to suit the taste buds. It is often unhygienic and extremely oily. Students have tried to change it by writing many letters but all in vain. Most students prefer  they bring from their home over canteen.',' Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering placement records have always been gratifying with more than 100% placement every year. All renowned companies come here. TCS, Infosys, Amdocs, L&T Infotech pick up maximum students with salaries ranging between Rs. 2.5 lacs p.a. to Rs. 4 lacs p.a. In recent years, placements have picked up even more, with some more dream companies like Google, IBM, Hewlett Packard, JP Morgan, Nerolac coming in and offering better packages.

Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology (Fr. CRIT), also popular known as \"Agnel Vashi\". Youll reach the colelge in minimum fare or just slighly above that so its a good idea to share the rick between 2 or 3 people. Walking is also not a bad option as it doesnt take more than 15-20 minutes.',' Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology (Fr. CRIT) has a four storeyed building which houses the lecture rooms, faculty centres and most of the laboratories. It is connected to the two storeyed computerized library at the centre of the academic block. It has a WiFi network on campus but it is made available only after 6p.m and you have to go through some registration process which will surely make you give up eventually. Other facilities available to the students include a cafetaria, a football ground, 5 basketball court, a gymnasium, medical centre and the hostel facilities housed in the twin 7 storeyed hostel buildings in the campus. There is even a swimming pool and students can use it twice a week at a nominal Rs 15. Overall, the infrastructure is top-notch.',' Excellent. Faculty is good in the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering streams of Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology (Fr. CRIT). Although, the same cannot be said about the Computer and IT faculty, its much better than many of so-called top institutes. Teachers make sure the portion is completed well within time. Presentations are made by the teachers so that the students understand better. Doubts are always welcome. The faculty makes sure that at the end of the semester the student is well versed with the subject.',' Very strict. Term work marks are given in proportion to your attendance starting with zero marks for 75% attendance and 5 marks for more than 90% attendance. Defaulters are made to attend lectures during the preparatory leave period until their balance is compensated. So donâ€™t you think youâ€™ll get away with low attendance out here.',' Not at all bad though it might take some getting used-to if youre from proper Mumbai. This is probably because most students are from Navi Mumbai itself. Their thinking and way of life is a bit different (that, in no way, means that its bad). Mumbaikars may feel a bit uncomfortable surrounded by so many of them all the time. Most of them are sincere and studious. If you are not one, you might have tough times. Many Catholic students can be expected as there is a religious minority quota from year 2013-14.',' Food is average and moderately cheap at Fr. Agnel Institute of Technologys canteen. Modern ventilation techniques have been installed, but the are of no help during peak hours. It is so hot that you could die of suffocation. A good variety of food is available including soups.

Their library is poorly lit and students never feel like studying there. Surprisingly there is a well equipped gymnasium cum gymkhana.

Infrastructure is still developing but at very sluggish pace and students often wonder where does the money paid by them as fees go, if not in infrastructure?',' Faculty at Viva Institute of Technology is not bad, average. Although most of them don’t have much experience in teaching and are only fresher, they manage to teach well somehow. The experienced professors are very good.

Train frequency is horrible and you must learn central rail timetables by heart in order to not miss the desired train. It is furhter 15 kms away from the station taking around 30 minutes to reach by college buses or by shared taxi. Due to this many students prefer staying in hostels or in rented apartments nearby.',' VOGCOE has a large campus with lots of open space and a big garden. There are separate buildings for each year of engineering.

The classrooms, though not air-conditioned, are spacious and well-ventilated and have a nice lush green view. Playgrounds and sports facilities are also up-to-the mark. However, there is one complain common among students, which is about not having internet connectivity within the campus.',' Faculties have improved a lot since the inception of the college. Most of the faculties are experienced. They are very cooperative and open to any number of doubts. One notable thing about many of the faculties is that they are very spiritual. They wish morning by saying \"Om Gurudev\" and expect you to wish back with an â€œOm gurudevâ€!',' Attendance is taken quite seriously in this college.

For other branches, it is not much of an issue, on a simple condition that you do not spoil your relations with the professors. â€œPanga mat lena mere dostâ€ says a final year Computers student. However, there are always exceptions and you have to identify those professors and attend their lectures regularly.',' Crowd at VJTI is sad; rather, nerdy would be more appropriate. Students get engrossed when it comes to technical festivals, be it their own college fest or any other, and this happens all round the year. Students from the Reserved Category are seen in healthy numbers (Thanks to the 50% reservation quota)',' VJTI canteen is certainly not bad for a government college. There are cleanliness issues; often it stinks a bit, but overflowing with students most of the times. Though it is quiet spacious, during lunch break, youâ€™ll have to strive hard to find a place. The food is damn cheap and tasty, too. Ragada Samosa (Rs. 20), Fried Rice (Rs. 35) and Samosa Pav (Rs. 10) are the hot favourites. Non-vegetarians also wonâ€™t regret.',' Placements at VJTI are certainly top notch. The college has consistently maintained the cent percent streak for most of the department.

Multinational companies like Microsoft (16 lpa), Google (19.95 lpa), Goldman Sachs, Oracle, Morgan Stanely, Yahoo and Deloitte also place a few students sometimes. Amongst mass recruiters Infosys, L&T and Cognizant tops the chart. Average salary is around 3.5 lakhs p.a. Special thing about placements here is that core engineering branches of Civil, Mechanical & Electrical donâ€™t have to compromise by taking up an IT job.
